# Midnight Deploy

Deploy Midnight smart contracts to local development environment or preview network (testnet).

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Deploying a new Compact contract
- Starting local Midnight infrastructure
- Connecting to preview network (testnet)
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- Setting up development environment

## How It Works

1. Compiles Compact contract to WebAssembly + ZK circuits
2. Starts required infrastructure (node, indexer, proof server)
3. Deploys contract with initial state
4. Returns contract address for frontend integration

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

```bash
# Check Compact compiler
compact check

# Check Node.js
node -v  # v23+

# Check Docker (for local infrastructure)
docker -v
```

## Local Development (Standalone)

### Start Local Infrastructure

```bash
# From project root
npm run setup-standalone
```

This starts:
- **Midnight Node**: `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`
- **Indexer**: `http://127.0.0.1:8088`
- **Proof Server**: `http://127.0.0.1:6300`

### Deploy to Local

```bash
# Build contract first
cd counter-contract
npm run build

# Deploy via CLI
cd ../counter-cli
npm run deploy:local
```

## Preview Network (Testnet)

### Configure Environment

Create `counter-cli/.env`:
```env
MY_PREVIEW_MNEMONIC="your twelve word mnemonic phrase here"
MY_UNDEPLOYED_UNSHIELDED_ADDRESS=""
```

### Get Test Tokens

1. Visit [Midnight Faucet](https://faucet.preview.midnight.network/)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Receive tSTAR tokens

### Deploy to Preview

```bash
# Build contract
cd counter-contract
npm run build

# Deploy to testnet
cd ../counter-cli
npm run deploy:preview
```

## Deployment Output

Successful deployment returns:

```json
{
  "contractAddress": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "deploymentTxHash": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
  "network": "preview",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Configure Frontend

After deployment, update frontend environment:

```env
# frontend-vite-react/.env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x1234567890abcdef..."
```

## Network Configuration

### Local (Standalone)
```typescript
const config = {
  node: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944",
  indexer: "http://127.0.0.1:8088",
  proofServer: "http://127.0.0.1:6300",
};
```

### Preview (Testnet)
```typescript
const config = {
  node: "wss://rpc.preview.midnight.network",
  indexer: "https://indexer.preview.midnight.network",
  proofServer: "https://proof.preview.midnight.network",
};
```

## Deployment Script

For automated deployments, use:

```bash
bash /path/to/skills/midnight-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh [network] [contract-path]
```

**Arguments:**
- `network` - Target network: `local` or `preview` (default: `local`)
- `contract-path` - Path to contract directory (default: current directory)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Deploy to local
bash scripts/deploy.sh local ./counter-contract

# Deploy to preview testnet
bash scripts/deploy.sh preview ./counter-contract
```

## Present Results to User

After successful deployment:

```
Deployment successful!

Contract Address: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
Network: preview
Transaction: 0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12

Next steps:
1. Update VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS in frontend-vite-react/.env
2. Start frontend: npm run dev:frontend
3. Connect wallet and interact with contract
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Not Running
```
Error: Cannot connect to Docker daemon
```
**Solution**: Start Docker Desktop or Docker daemon

### Compact Compiler Not Found
```
Error: compact: command not found
```
**Solution**: Install Compact compiler:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
compact update +0.27.0
```

### Insufficient Funds
```
Error: Insufficient balance for transaction
```
**Solution**: Get test tokens from [faucet](https://faucet.preview.midnight.network/)

### Proof Server Timeout
```
Error: Proof generation timeout
```
**Solution**:
- Check proof server is running
- Simplify circuit complexity
- Increase timeout in config

### Contract Already Deployed
```
Error: Contract at address already exists
```
**Solution**: Use a new deployment or join existing contract

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Contract compiled successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Tests passing (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Environment variables configured (`.env`)
- [ ] Wallet funded with tSTAR (for preview)
- [ ] Infrastructure running (for local)
- [ ] Contract address saved
- [ ] Frontend configured
